# Big O:

## What can cause time in a function? ‚åö

* Operations (+, -, *, /)
* Comparisons (<, >, ==)
* Looping (for, while)
* Outside Function call (function())

## What causes Space complexity? üíæ

* Variables
* Data Structures
* Function Call
* Allocation

## Rule Book üìù

* **Rule 1:** Always worst Case;
* **Rule 2:** Remove Constants;
* **Rule 3:** Different inputs should have different variables. O(a+b). A and B arrays nested would be O(a*b);
* **Rule 4:** Drop Non-dominant term. **Eg.:** O(n^2) is greater than O(n), so the O(n^2) is dominant and it should drop the O(n) notation.


## Big Os üìà

* **O(1):** Constant- no loops
* **O(log N):** Logarithmic- usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search)
* **O(n):** Linear- for loops, while loops through n items
* **O(n log(n)):** Log Liniear- usually sorting operations
* **O(n^2):** Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two
nested loops
* **O(2^n):** Exponential- recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N
O(n!) Factorial- you are adding a loop for every element
