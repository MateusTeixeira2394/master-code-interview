# Master the Coding Interview

This repository stored some exercises and some concepts from the course [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/) from [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) platform.

I could choose any programming language, because the fundamentals are the same. So, I chose the javascript due to I have already good knowledge about it and to me it easier to execute it in my environment. This way, I could focus more in the concepts of the course.

Thus, through this exercises helped me to improve:

* Implementation using different Data Structures and different Algorithms 🧮📚🎄❄
* Computer science fundamentals; 🧪🔬
* Confidence for coding interviews; 😎
* Making code faster and less memory consuming; ⌚💾
