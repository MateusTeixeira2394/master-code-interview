# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming in computer science involves breaking down complex problems into simpler overlapping sub problems. Solutions to these sub problems are stored in a cache, allowing the algorithm to reuse previously computed results and avoid redundant calculations, thereby optimizing efficiency.

## Step to apply Dynamic Programming

1. Can be divided into sub problems?
2. Implement Recursive Solution!
3. Are there repetitive sub problems?
4. Memoize the sub problems!
